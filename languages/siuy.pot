"Siuy is a specialized WordPress theme dedicated to blogging, and it is "
"primarily made for the minimalistic book and writing lovers. The minimalist "
"implementation eliminates all elements that clutter the page, and it "
"complements your content perfectly while getting rid of unnecessary "
"animations and slideshows while you can make your bold statement loud and "
"clear with using theme's Jumbotron component and thanks to Schema.org markup "
"integration, your blog has a better chance of climbing those hyper-"
"competitive rankings. Siuy uses a live customizer to arrange all things in "
"real time, and it has several pre-built choices for header, footer, and even "
"blog feed layouts. Things that would have cost you thousands upon thousands "
"of dollars if you went to an agency are available for a minute fraction of "
"that price. If you like simplicity for news, stories and other writings, "
"then Siuy is ready to blog!"
